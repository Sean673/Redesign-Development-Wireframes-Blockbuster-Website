                            <p> Escalating climate change is turning the world economy upside down. With crops dying and food price spiking, FOOD has replaced oil as the world’s most valuable commodity.

In just three days, six former Marines must work together, find their long-lost brotherhood, stop a nationwide government- sanctioned genocide, and save millions of lives, for one last shot at redemption. Or die trying.</p>
